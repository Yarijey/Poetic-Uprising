# Poetic-Uprising
A mobile app that generates poetry by weaving together words from a diverse database of Queer Poets of Color (inspired by the book Nepantla : The first major literary anthology for Queer Poets of Color in the United States.) https://nightboat.org/book/nepantla-an-anthology-dedicated-to-queer-poets-of-color/

This app empowers users to create their own poems, edit, delete, like them and share their creations with friends, fostering a collaborative poetry-making experience. It's a space where every word matters, bridging poetry with community.
